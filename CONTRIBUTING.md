First of all, thanks for contributing!

This document provides some basic guidelines for contributing to this repository. To propose improvements, feel free to submit a PR.

## Submitting issues

* If you think you've found an issue, search the issue list to see if there's an existing issue.
* Then, if you find nothing, open a Github issue.

## Pull Requests

Have you fixed a bug or written a new feature and want to share it? Many thanks!

In order to ease/speed up our review, here are some items you can check/improve when submitting your PR:

  * Have a proper commit history (we advise you to rebase if needed).
  * Write tests for the code you wrote.
  * Preferably, make sure that all unit tests pass locally.
  * Summarize your PR with an explanatory title and a message describing your changes, cross-referencing any related bugs/PRs.
  * Open your PR against the `master` branch.

Your pull request must pass all CI tests before we merge it. If you see an error and don't think it's your fault, it may not be! [Join us on Slack][slack] or send us an email, and together we'll get it sorted out.

### Keep it small, focused

Avoid changing too many things at once. For instance if you're fixing a recipe and at the same time adding some code refactor, it makes reviewing harder and the _time-to-release_ longer.

### Commit messages

Please don't be this person: `git commit -m "Fixed stuff"`. Take a moment to write meaningful commit messages.

The commit message should describe the reason for the change and give extra details that will allow someone later on to understand in 5 seconds the thing you've been working on for a day.

### Squash your commits

Rebase your changes on `master` and squash your commits whenever possible. This keeps history cleaner and easier to revert things. It also makes developers happier!

## Development
